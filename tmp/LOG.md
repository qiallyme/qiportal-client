# QiPortal Development Log

## 2025-01-27 - Initial Setup
- Fixed workspace configuration
- Added missing dependencies (lucide-react, wouter, stripe, openai, drizzle-orm)
- Created UI components (button, card, dialog, textarea, input)
- Fixed import paths for @ui/* components
- Created AdminNavigation and AdminSidebar components
- Updated vite configs to use shared/ui instead of packages/ui

## Current Issues
- Server not starting due to drizzle-orm import resolution
- Multiple port conflicts from previous dev runs
- Need to clean up processes and restart cleanly

## 2025-09-05T14:31Z A0 -> ORCHESTRATOR: initialized coordination system
- Set up STATE.json with proper lock structure
- DEPS area locked by A# worker (active)
- Created RUNBOOK.md with current sprint goals
- Established coordination protocol for A1(ROUTES) and A2(CONFIG+TYPES)

## 2025-09-05T18:34:33Z A1 -> ROUTES: lock granted

## 2025-09-05T18:35:00Z A1 -> ROUTES: COMPLETED
- ✅ Fixed client entry mismatch: apps/client/index.html already correctly points to /src/main.tsx
- ✅ Added missing /dashboard route to client App.tsx with ClientDashboard component
- ✅ Created proper routing for admin app with App.tsx and Routes structure
- ✅ Organized components into proper directories (kb/, client/)
- ✅ Created missing ClientNavigation and ClientSidebar placeholder components
- ✅ Fixed import paths for KnowledgeBaseSidebar and AiChatSidebar
- ✅ Verified all routes exist: /, /login, /dashboard, /messaging, /knowledge-base, /settings, /invoices
- ✅ TypeScript errors reduced from 79 to 32 (routing issues resolved)
- ✅ Development server started successfully

### Routes Status:
- `/` → Landing page ✅
- `/login` → Login page ✅  
- `/dashboard` → ClientDashboard (protected) ✅
- `/messaging` → Messaging page (protected) ✅
- `/knowledge-base` → Knowledge Base page (protected) ✅
- `/settings` → Settings page (protected) ✅
- `/invoices` → Invoice Management (protected) ✅
- Admin app: `/` and `/dashboard` → AdminDashboard ✅

### Remaining Issues:
- 32 TypeScript errors remain (mostly missing dependencies: clsx, tailwind-merge, @radix-ui/*)
- These are not routing-related and don't cause 404s
- All navigation routes now render visible screens without 404 errors
