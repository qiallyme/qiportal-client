- Create embeddings of all documentation sections for semantic search.
- Tag sections with relevant metadata for improved retrieval.
- Update vector database when documentation changes.

## Visualization
- Map each heading into Obsidian Canvas nodes for visual navigation.
- Color-code nodes by module for easier identification.
- Connect related concepts with directional arrows.
- Include decision trees for complex workflows.

## AI Assistant Training
