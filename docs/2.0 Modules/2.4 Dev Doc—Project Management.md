## Overview

This document defines the structure and workflow for implementing a lightweight **Project Management system** into the client-facing portal.

Goal: Give the client real-time visibility into milestones, tasks, costs, and time estimates without needing Zoho Projects.

## Core Structure

### 1. Wiki Framework

- Each **Milestone/Project** is a **Notion page**.
- Each project page shows: Roadmap snapshot, filtered task database, supporting docs.

### 2. Master Tasks Database

- All tasks live in a central Tasks DB.
- Projects filter tasks by milestone.

## Database Schema

|Property|Type|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|Task Name|Title|Task description|
|Milestone / Project|Relation|Links to project|
|Status|Select|Inbox, Urgent, Needs, Wants, Done|
|Owner|Person/Text|Who is responsible|
|Dependency|Relation|Prerequisite tasks|
|Cost Estimate|Number ($)|Budget estimate|
|Time Estimate|Number (hrs)|Effort estimate|
|Deliverable Missing|Checkbox|Flag missing client input|
|Notes / Docs|Text/Files|References|
|Created/Updated|Auto|Audit trail|
|Priority|Select|Low, Medium, High, Critical|
|Due Date|Date|Deadline for completion|
|Client Visibility|Checkbox|Whether client can see task|

## Views

- **Kanban** by Status
- **Table** with cost & time
- **Timeline** (optional)
- **By Project** (linked DBs)
- **By Priority** for team focus
- **By Due Date** for deadline management
- **Client View** (filtered for client visibility)

## Rollups at Project Level

- Total Cost, Total Time, Remaining Tasks
- Percentage Complete
- Blocked Tasks (with dependencies)
- Budget Utilization

## Workflow

1. Add Task: Create new tasks with required fields
2. Check Dependencies: Identify and link prerequisites
3. Client View: Review what client can see
4. Weekly Sweep: Regular status updates
5. Priority Assessment: Adjust based on changing needs
6. Status Updates: Move tasks through pipeline
7. Completion Review: Final check before marking done

## Best Practices

- Keep it lean (KISS)
- Force status buckets
- Use dependencies sparingly
- Transparency on missing deliverables
- Weekly audit
- Clear task names (verb + object format)
- Realistic time/cost estimates
- Consistent owner assignment
- Regular client-facing updates

## Future Enhancements

- Finance DB linkage
- Automations (Notion API / [Make.com](http://make.com/))
- Snapshots (static HTML)
- Mobile app integration
- Client comment system
- Advanced reporting dashboard
- Time tracking integration
- AI-assisted task prioritization

## Example Layout

```
Projects (DB)
 ├── Tax Prep (Page)
 │    ├── Tasks (filtered)
 │    ├── Rollups: Cost, Time, Remaining
 │    └── Subpages: Receipts
 ├── Website Build (Page)
 │    ├── Tasks (filtered)
 │    └── Subpages: Design, Hosting
 └── Onboarding (Page)
      └── Tasks (filtered)

```

## Example Status Flow

- Inbox → Urgent → Needs → Wants → Done

### Summary

This setup transforms the client-facing wiki into a **lightweight project management tool**:

- Centralized tasks
- Milestone dashboards
- Transparent scope (cost + time)
- Live progress visible to client
