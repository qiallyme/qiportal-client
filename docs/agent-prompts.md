## Coordination Rules

- **A1(ROUTES)** and **A2(CONFIG+TYPES)** may run in parallel on different areas
- **A3(SERVER)** must wait for A1 and A2 to complete
- **A#(DEPS)** can run independently but affects all other agents
- All agents must request/release locks through A0 Orchestrator
- All work must be logged in tmp/LOG.md with timestamps
- All results must update tmp/STATE.json for traceability
